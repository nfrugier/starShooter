# starShooter

The game is playable [here](https://thrandal.itch.io/starshooter)

### Requirements

* a web browser
* to run locally, a webserver or a simple php server is better (to bypass CORS policies on Chrome, i.e)
* some assets since I don't upload them*

### *About the assets

For legal reasons I don't push the copyrighted assets files on git even though I own all the files 
and have all rights to use them (I don't have the rights to share them). You can replace them by your own assets 
(don't forget to rename them or to change the paths).

However, `starshooter_main.mp3` is available for free on my [SoundCloud Page](https://soundcloud.com/thrandal/starshooter-main) since I made it myself.

To add the same assets, I used these :
* [8-bit SFX pack](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/8-bit-sfx-pack/)
* [Pixel Art Spaceships for SHMUP](https://www.gamedevmarket.net/asset/pixel-art-spaceships-for-shmup/)
